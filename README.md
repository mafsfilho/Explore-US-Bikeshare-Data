### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
I've created this code to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

### Files used
I used 3 .csv files containing the company data. It was named chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv.

### Credits
I would like to thank my uncle that helped me fixing an error and clearing my mind to easily find other errors-causers that could arise.
